Error: Unable to scrape website text. Could not find Chrome (ver. 128.0.6613.137). This can occur if either
 1. you did not perform an installation before running the script (e.g. `npx puppeteer browsers install ${browserType}`) or
 2. your cache path is incorrectly configured (which is: C:\Users\jrose\.cache\puppeteer).
For (2), check out our guide on configuring puppeteer at https://pptr.dev/guides/configuration.
