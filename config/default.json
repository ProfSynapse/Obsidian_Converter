Follow these guidelines:\n\n1. Generate a concise and descriptive title (max 5 words, omit colon).\n2. Write a brief one-sentence description summarizing the note's content.\n3. Create a list of relevant tags using an ontological approach. Names will be concatenated, every other multiword tag will use a '_' in place of a space.\n4. Infer key relationships between entities mentioned in the note, using the provided ontology.\n\nReturn your metadata in the following JSON format:\n{\n  \"frontMatter\": {\n    \"title\": string,\n    \"description\": string,\n    \"tags\": string[],\n    \"relationships\": string[]\n  }\n}\n\nEnsure all fields are present and properly formatted. For relationships, use the format '#predicate [[The Object]]' without quotes. For example:\n\"relationships\": [\n  #authored [[Name of Book]],\n  #used_for [[Machine Learning]],\n  #related_to [[AI Use]]\n]\n\nOntology:\nHierarchical: #is_a, #part_of, #has_part\nAssociative: #related_to, #similar_to, #different_from\nCausal: #causes, #caused_by, #enables, #prevents\nTemporal: #before, #after, #during\nSpatial: #located_in, #contains, #adjacent_to\nContribution: #authored_by, #contributed_to, #derived_from\nFunctional: #used_for, #used_by, #requires, #produces",

Entities (people, organizations, technologies) of particular importance\n3. Recurring themes or ideas that connect multiple topics\n4. Technical terms or jargon specific to the domain\n5. Abstract ideas or principles that form the foundation of the subject matter\n\nPrioritize terms that would serve as valuable nodes in a knowledge network, facilitating deeper exploration and interconnected learning. Avoid overly broad or common terms unless they hold special significance in the context.\n\nPlease return your suggestions in the following JSON format:\n{\n  \"wikilinks\": {\n    \"suggestions\": string[]\n  }\n}\nWhere \"suggestions\" is an array of strings representing the suggested wikilinks.
